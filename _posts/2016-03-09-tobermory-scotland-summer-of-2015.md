Tobermory - visited UK Summer of 2015

I picked this photo to see what The Grid would do with it. It seems that if you want to crop or enhance photographs it is better to do this outside of The Grid as - so far - there do not appear to be any tools for doing this within it. However, having already posted several other photographs it looks like AI does a lot of cropping, rendering and formatting itself. When I had a highly artistic setting some of the results were spectacular.
