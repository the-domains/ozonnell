Just checking you can paste text in from a web site without it automatically becoming hyper-linked to the original.

This system helps you get to bed on time, sleep better, and wake up the next morning well rested and ready for battle.

10 hours before bed -- No more caffeine.

3 hours before bed -- No more food or alcohol.

2 hours before bed -- No more work.

1 hour before bed -- No more screen time (turn off all phones, TVs and computers).

0 -- The number of times you will hit the snooze button in the morning.
