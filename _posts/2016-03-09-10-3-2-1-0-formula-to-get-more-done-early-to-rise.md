description: 'Before he discovered the Formula, my friend Bedros Keuilian struggled to control his mornings. That lead to a constant feeling of being rushed and falling behind schedule... which in turn lead to feeling anxious all day long. But when he put my Perfect Day Formula into place, his problems were solved.'
